        Rain, rain, go away I found a love for me
        Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
        Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
        Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
        'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
        Not knowing what it was
        I will not give you up this time
        But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
        And in your eyes, you're holding mine
        Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
        But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight<br> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
        Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
        But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
        Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
        She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
        I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
        To carry love, to carry children of our own
        We are still kids, but we're so in love
        Fighting against all odds
        I know we'll be alright this time
        Darling, just hold my hand
        Be my girl, I'll be your man
        I see my future in your eyes</p>
